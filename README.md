# AskMate (sprint 3)

# About The Project

In the previous sprint we created a website that has the functionality of a basic stackoverflow. We changed the data being stored in a CSV file and implemented a database structure to our website.


### Technologies Used

Our project leverages a variety of technologies to create a seamless and feature-rich web application:

- **Python Flask**: A lightweight and flexible web framework for building web applications in Python.
- **HTML**: For crafting the structure of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic features to the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL**: As our relational database management system, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
- **Jinja2**: A templating engine for Python used for rendering HTML templates.
- **Git**: A version control system for collaborative development and code management.

To get started with Ask Mate 3, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/ask-mate-3-python-juhaszszabolcs90.git

Prerequisites
Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python: If not already installed, download and install Python from the Python official website.
Pip: The Python package installer, usually included with Python installations. If not, you can install it separately.
Virtual Environment (optional): It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. Install it using:


Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Create a PostgreSQL database and update the config.py file with the database configuration.

Run the application:
  -python app.py
